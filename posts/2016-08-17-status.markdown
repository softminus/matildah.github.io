title: NTP implementation status, part 2
---

I have a working NTP client that works in a unikernel; and I am working on cleanup / testing / MirageOS integration work as well as properly packaging the code/data in a single module that is NTP-independent (so it can be reused for PTP and other time synchronization protocols) and an NTP-only module that handles all the NTP awfulness (such as leap seconds). This project isn't dead, I've just needed to take some time off working on it for personal reasons.
